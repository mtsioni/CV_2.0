        <h2>🎶🎵</h2>
        Music has been a soulful and constant companion since the tender age of 5, and although
        my journey with the piano has taken an unexpected turn, through the ups and downs of life,
        its profound impact remains. <br>
        The melodies that flow from my fingertips, continue to serve as a powerful 
        means of expression.  <br>
        Music its always going be this one stable element in my life that
        sculpted me to the person and the adult I am today, through patience, perseverance 
        and a gigantic will, it taught me the stoic path of understanding and living life.

        But that's not all—I have a passion for solving real-life puzzles. 
        Unraveling complexities and discovering innovative solutions fuels my appetite 
        for mental challenges. It's a way for me to exercise my analytical skills and 
        embrace the thrill of problem-solving beyond the realm of code, while at the same 
        time it serves as a meditation tool for the days that I want to clear the fog I have in my head.

        <h2>🧠🫀</h2>
        As a curious soul, I find myself drawn to captivating science documentaries, 
        unlocking the mysteries of the universe one fascinating fact at a time. 
        Lately, I have been particularly excited about documentaries related to the mental 
        and physiological development of babies. It is magical to discover the unknown of 
        the infant brains and to realize how evolved, special and unique creatures they are. <br>
        Additionally, I find myself drawn to the gripping world of true crime, that offers
        gripping narratives that fuel my passion for storytelling and puzzle-solving.

        tailored to perfection. The gentle aroma, the invigorating flavors, and the subtle 
        sweetness of stevia create a symphony of delight, energizing me for the adventures
